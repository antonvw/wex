Each macro can have several commands, a 
command is encoded if the content refers to a
control character.  

Variables are expanded when playing back the macro. Three
types are supported:
CONFIG:  expansion is done with value from the config
BUILTIN: expansion is done using internal value
ENVIRONMENT: expansion is done using environment value
