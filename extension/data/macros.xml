Name:      macros.xml
Purpose:   vi macros and variables for wxextension.
Author:    Anton van Wezenbeek
Copyright: (c) 2012, Anton van Wezenbeek

Both variables and names have a "name" attribute, you call the macro
from vi mode using @name@. If the name is a single character c, you can call it
using @c.

Each macro can have several commands, a 
command is encoded if the content refers to a
control character.  

Variables are expanded when playing back the macro. 
- A variable can have a "type" attribute.
  The next "type" values are supported:
  - BUILTIN:     
    Expansion is done using internal value, so you cannot add your own.
  - ENVIRONMENT: 
    Expansion is done using environment value, you can add your own,
    as long as they are part of the environment variables.
  - INPUT:       
    Expansion is done by asking value from user. You can add your own.
  - INPUT-ONCE:  
    Expansion is done by asking value from user, value is saved.
    The next time this value is used for expansion, no input is asked for.
    You can add your own.
  - INPUT-SAVE:  
    Expansion is done by asking value from user, value is saved.
    You can add your own.
  - TEMPLATE:
    Expansion is done by reading the value from a template file. This
    file is specified in the contents of the node. In the file you
    can use macro variables as well.
  
  If you do not specify this attribute, then the variable is expanded
  to the xml contents as specified here.
  
- A variable can have a "prefix" attribute. 
  This attribute causes a comment line to be generated that is prefixed with
  the value of this attribute, according to the "type" attribute.
  
Comments you add within xml elements are not saved when you edit macros.
