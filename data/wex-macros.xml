Name:      wex-macros.xml
Purpose:   vi macros, variables, abbreviations and key maps for wex.
Author:    Anton van Wezenbeek

Both variables and macros have a "name" attribute, you call them
from vi mode using @name@ (if name starts with an
uppercase letter). If the name is a register c, you can call it
using @c (lowercase). From vi you can record a register using q 
followed by a letter, and ending with a q as well.

For date variables you can also specify a format attribute to 
format your own date. Default the ISO date is used as format.
  
An abbreviation is expanded during insertion when you enter
the text. From vi you can enter an abbreviation using :ab.

A key map allows you to use your owh shortcuts for vi or ex
commands. From vi you can enter a map using :map.

Each macro can have several commands.  

Variables are expanded when playing back the macro. 
- A variable can have a "type" attribute.
  The next "type" values are supported:
  - BUILTIN:     
    Expansion is done using internal value, so you cannot add your own.
  - ENVIRONMENT: 
    Expansion is done using environment value, you can add your own,
    as long as they are part of the environment variables.
  - FIXED:  
    Expands to fixed value as specified in the contents of the node.
  - INPUT:       
    Expansion is done by asking value from user. You can add your own.
  - INPUT-ONCE:  
    Expansion is done by asking value from user, value is saved.
    The next time this value is used for expansion, no input is asked for.
    You can add your own.
  - INPUT-SAVE:  
    Expansion is done by asking value from user, value is saved.
    You can add your own.
    This is the default value when you add your own variable from vi.
  - PROCESS:       
    Expansion is done by running the process, as specified in
    the contents of the node.
    You can add an argument for a variable that can be used as stdin 
    for the process by adding it between quotes when calling the process.
    E.g. @Process'HW'@ adds the value of variable @HW@ as argument to
    the process.
  - TEMPLATE:
    Expansion is done by reading the value from a template file. This
    file is specified in the contents of the node. In the file you
    can use macro variables as well.
  
  If you do not specify this attribute, then the variable is expanded
  to the xml contents as specified here.
  Finally a variable can be initialized using another variable 
  using the @OTHER@ as contents for that variable referring
  to the OTHER variable to for initialization. E.g. see the Copyright variable.
  
- A variable can have a "prefix" attribute. 
  This attribute causes a comment line to be generated that is prefixed with
  the value of this attribute, according to the "type" attribute.
