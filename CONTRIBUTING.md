# How to contribute

- make an issue

- fork the repository on GitHub

- create a feature branch for that issue from the develop branch to base your work

## Adding functionality

- use style as indicated by .clang-format

- use STL whenever possible

- doxy document sources
  API documentation is generated from the sources
  using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)

- translation is done using xgettext by invoking po-sync.sh
  - to translate wex copy the wex.pot file to the correct language po
    file, and fill in the translation.

  - The place where to put your po files can be found by adding -l command-line switch.
    You can also test other languages using the special Language config item,
    e.g. setting it to french allows you to test french translation.
    Normally you check the current locale by running locale on the
    command-line. Running locale -a shows all your available locales, if your
    locale is not present, add it using locale-gen (provided it is in
    the list of all locales (/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED).
    Then you do export LANG=..., or change the /etc/default/locale.

  - To add translation files add -l switch to build-gen

## Analyse it

At GitHub some code analysers will do this, it is also possible to do
some local checks, these are invoked using the analyse target:

```bash
ninja analyse
```

## Test it

- when updating one of the GitHub workflows yml files, use e.g
  [yamlchecker](https://yamlchecker.com) to check the changed file

- add a test (and update sample)

```bash
./build-gen.sh -s -t
```

- test coverage can be generated by add -c switch to build-gen
  This requires `lcov` and `genhtml` tools (part of lcov).
  Also, when pushing commits, test coverage is done automatically using
  the GitHub workflow ccpp.yml.

```bash
./build-gen.sh -c -t
ninja lcov-prep
ctest -VV
ninja lcov
```

- asan Leak Sanitizer can be used by adding -a switch to build-gen

```bash
./build-gen.sh -a -t
export ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1,detect_container_overflow=0
./test/core/wex-test-core
```

- Do a pull request from the feature branch to the develop branch
