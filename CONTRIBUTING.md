# How to contribute

- Fork the repository on GitHub

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work

## Adding functionality

- use STL whenever possible 

- run [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)

- icons and bitmaps
  - menu and toolbar bitmaps are from wxWidgets, using wxArtProvider

  - application icons from [Tango](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project),   
  [converted to ico](http://www.convertico.com/),   
  [converted to xpm using GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/),   
  [convert to mac icns (first make 128 by 128 icon)](http://iconverticons.com/)

- doxy document sources  
  API documentation is generated from the sources 
  using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
  
- add a test and update sample
 
- translation is done using [poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)    
  - wxExtension has it's own localization file, your application should
    also add it's own one (add '_()' around text strings), 
    and also put the standard wxWidgets localization file
    in the localization dir.  

  - The place where to put your po files can be found by adding -l command line switch.
    You can also test other languages using the special LANG config item,
    e.g. setting it to 80 allows you to test french translation
    (see wxWidgets/misc/languages/langtabl.txt).
    Normally you check the current locale by running locale on the
    command line. Running locale -a shows all your available locales, if your
    locale is not present, add it using locale-gen (provided it is in 
    the list of all locales (/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED).
    Then you do export LANG=..., or change the /etc/default/locale.
    
## Test it

- `mkdir build`   
  `cd build`   
  `cmake ..`   
  `make`   
  `make test`  

- test coverage can be generated by using `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage`    
  This requires `lcov` and `genhtml` tools (part of lcov, v1.9).    
  `mkdir Coverage`   
  `cd Coverage`   
  `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage ..`   
  `make`  
  `make lcov-prep`  
  `make test`  
  `make lcov`
