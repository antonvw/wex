# How to contribute

- Fork the repository on GitHub

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work

## Adding functionality

- use STL whenever possible 

- make files are generated using [Bakefile 0.2.9](http://www.bakefile.org/)  

- icons and bitmaps
  - menu and toolbar bitmaps are from wxWidgets, using wxArtProvider

  - application icons from [Tango](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project),
  [converted to ico](http://www.convertico.com/), 
  [converted to xpm using GIMP 2.6.6)](http://www.gimp.org/), 
  [convert to mac icns (first make 128 by 128 icon)](http://iconverticons.com/)

- doxy document sources  
  API documentation is generated from the sources 
  using [Doxygen 1.8.3.1](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
  
- add or update sample

- translation is done using [poedit 1.5.4](http://www.poedit.net/)    
  - wxExtension has it's own localization file, your application should
    also add it's own one (add '_()' around text strings), 
    and also put the standard wxWidgets localization file
    in the localization dir.  

  - The place where to put your po files can be found by adding -l comand line switch.
    You can also test other languages using the special LANG config item,
    e.g. setting it to 80 allows you to test french translation
    (see wxWidgets/misc/languages/langtabl.txt).
    
## Test it

- automated testing is done using [cppunit 1.12](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit):   
    `sudo apt-get install libcppunit-dev`  
  - run `test-all.sh` from the build dir, which collects output in several log files. 

  - test coverage can be generated by running `coverage.sh`
    This requires `lcov` and `genhtml` tools (part of lcov, v1.9).
    
  - run [cppcheck 1.59](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) to catch remaining errors.
