# roadmap

## why are we doing this?

- vi / ex functionality is available in a library
- keep in pace with c++ standard
- keep in pace with boost c++ libraries
- keep in pace with wxWidgets

## when are we doing this?

- c++ standard is updated every 3 years, we follow as early as possible
- publishing a stable c++ library each 6 months

## what exactly are we doing?

- offering a stable master branch that results in a
  cmake buildable library with classes that
  extend wxWidgets classes with vi / ex classes, using
  c++ standard and boost c++ libraries
- offering a develop branch that builds and runs all tests
  on macOS, MSW, Linux without errors and contains new
  functionality
